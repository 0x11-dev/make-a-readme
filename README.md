# [Make a README](https://makeareadme.com)
Make a README is a simple website that explains what a README is, what the
benefits are, and what makes for a good README. It also provides an editable
template, with live Markdown rendering.

I hope people who are new to programming will find it useful, but even for
more experienced programmers, I think it's worth evaluating once
in a while if we are doing a good job when it comes to the
[small details](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) that
can matter more than we might think.

Make a README is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## Contributing
Please feel free to submit an issue or pull request. The website is simple
enough to not require a build process. Just open `public/index.html` in a
browser.

If you want [live reloading](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) and have
Node installed, run `$ yarn install && yarn start`. If you have Python and
Docker installed, you can run `$ ./dev start` instead.
