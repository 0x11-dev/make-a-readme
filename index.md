# Keep a README
Because nobody can read your mind (yet)

## Introduction

### What is a README?
A [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) is a text file that introduces
a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what
the project is about.

### Why should I make a README?
It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will likely have
regarding how to install and use your project or how to collaborate with you.

### Who should make a README?
Anyone who is creating a programming project.

### When should I make a README?
Definitely before you show a project to anybody or make it public. You might
want to get into the habit of making it the [first file you
create](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
in a new project.

### Where should I put the README?
In the top level directory of the project. This is where someone who is new to
your project will start out. Code hosting services such as
[GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) will also look for your README and display
it along with the list of files and directories in your project.

## How
While READMEs can be written in any text file format, the most common one
that is used nowadays is [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
You can learn more about it [here](http://commonmark.org/), which also has a
helpful [reference guide](http://commonmark.org/help/) and an [interactive
tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

Some other formats are [plain
text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file),
[reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText), and
[Textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)).

## What's Next?
If your project is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software),
it's [important](https://blog.codinghorror.com/pick-a-license-any-license/)
to include a [license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license).
You can use [this website](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you pick one.

Keep a README is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/). A
[changelog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog) is another file that is
very useful for programming projects.

A README is a crucial but basic way of conveying information.  While every
project should at least have a README, more involved ones can also benefit from
a dedicated documentation website or a
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki).  [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/),
[Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-a-wiki-221449748.html), and
[GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/wiki/index.html) all support
maintaining a wiki alongside your project.

Here are some tools and services that can help you generate a documentation website:
* [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)
* [ReadMe](https://readme.io/)
* [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)
* [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate)
* [Daux.io](http://daux.io/)
